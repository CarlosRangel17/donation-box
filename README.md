# Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

## `yarn dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## `yarn test`

Launches the test runner

## `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and ready to be deployed!

## `yarn start`

Starts the node server from the build output

# Deploy

- Any pushed branch with /features/\*\* will be deployed to the DEV environment
- Any push to master will be deployed to the UAT environment
- Any pushed branch with /releases/\*\* will be deployed to Production. 

# Folder Architecture

- public: static assets
- src: The app
  - artifacts: Smart Contract ABI's
  - components: React components
  - layout: Core UI layout that each page uses (Header, Meta)
  - pages: Each file/folder adds a new page to the app
  - styles: Global styles. Ask yourself why am I putting a style here before doing so. It will be rendered on EVERY page throughout the site. Variables go here.
  - consts: constant static variables
  - contexts: A gathering place for all contexts used within app
  - hooks: Reusable React custom hooks
  - svg: svg icons. Self explanatory
  - utils: utility functions that can be reused (formatters, validators, calculations, etc)
  - types: all interfaces and types use throughout multiple components are kept here

# Notes

- This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

- This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case for a Donation Box.

- To add a new route, add a file or folder to `/src/pages/`. [More information on dynamic routing here](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages)

- Try to use CSS modules for styling. Add a file like this component.module.scss next to the component where you'll use the styles.

- Add global SCSS variables in `/src/styles/variables.scss`. If there are any global styles, add them to `src/pages/_app.tsx` (please limit these as they'll be added to EVERY page)

- Sometimes when you install a 3rd party dependency, you'll need to install the types for typescript

```
yarn add -D @types/[dependency]
```
